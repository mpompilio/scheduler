# scheduler

Description

This project is meant for giving yourself tasks throughout the day! When you type into a field, and click the save botton, it will save it into the localStorage!

Also, based on the time of day, the colors of the text areas will change! If the time is passed, the color will be gray, if the time is current, then it will turn red, and if the time is still yet to come, the color will be green!

The current day is also displayed at the top!
